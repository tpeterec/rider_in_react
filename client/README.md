# Rider: For motorcycle riders, by motorcycle riders

The React Version

# Inspiration
As a fellow motorcycle rider, connecting with other riders in the community can be a hassle at times. The main avenues for connecting with other riders are typically outdated website forums or Facebook groups. I don’t know about you, but I barely touch Facebook as it is, except for Marketplace if I’m selling something, and that's a big if. Seeing dating apps take the romantic side of humanity by storm, I was inspired by their convenience, ease of use, and saw an opportunity to connect other motorcyclists together in the activity they love in the same format.

# How to use Rider
My blog post goes over the features of the app more in depth. So, instead of retyping, I will paste the link to my Medium blog post down below. My previous version of the app in Vanilla Javascript has more functionality. This app has a few different alteration.

    1. The "No" button deletes the current rider from the database as a way for the current user to never see that rider again. 

    2. When you create an account with the "Sign Up" button on the homepage, you need to refresh the page as of right. That way, the current account you made populates on the webpage. This will be fixed shortly. 

    3. There is no update account information as of right now. This will be a part of further revisions.

Thank you to Rane, Jacob, and Nick for helping me learn React and sort through data as it dynamically renders onto the page. It was very challenging to learn React and altered method of thinking that the framework requires. 

Please reach out to me if you have any questions of feedback! I am always learning.
